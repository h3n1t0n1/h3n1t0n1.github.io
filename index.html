        <h3>CSS Selectors and specificity</h3>
        <img class="css" src="./pictures/CSS tags.jpg" alt="">
        <p>There are a bunch of different css syntax and selectors, but the main purpose of CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language that is used in combination with HTML that customizes how HTML elements will appear. CSS can define styles and change the layout and design of a sheet. </p>
        <h3>Link Elements</h3>
        <p>
            The <link> element is used to link HTML documents to external resources like CSS files. It commonly uses:   
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>href attribute to specify the URL to the external resource</li>
            <li>rel attribute to specify the relationship of the linked document to the current document</li>
            <li>type attribute to define the type of content being linked</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Write CSS in seperate Files</h3>
        <p>CSS code can be written in its own files to keep it separate from the HTML code. The extension for CSS files is .css. These can be linked to an HTML file using a <link> tag in the <head> section.</p>
         <h3>CSS type selectors</h3>  
         <p>CSS type selectors are used to match all elements of a given type or tag name. Unlike for HTML syntax, we do not include the angle brackets when using type selectors for tag names. When using type selectors, elements are matched regardless of their nesting level in the HTML</p>
        <h3>CSS class selectors</h3>
        <p>The CSS class selector matches elements based on the contents of their class attribute. For selecting elements having calendar-cell as the value of the class attribute, a . needs to be prepended.</p>
            <h3></h3>
        </div>
</body>
